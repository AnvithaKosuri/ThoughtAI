# ThoughtAI
Low-fidelity prototype and design documentation for ThoughtAI, an iPad based AI study tool that guides students through problem solving without giving full solutions.

This folder now includes a minimal static website you can publish with GitHub Pages.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main site HTML
- `styles.css` — simple styles for the site

Publish steps (recommended):

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this project.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add starter website"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. On GitHub, enable GitHub Pages from the repository Settings → Pages, and choose `main` branch (root) as the source.

3. Your site will be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/` within a minute.

If you prefer an automated deploy, consider using the `gh-pages` branch or GitHub Actions.
